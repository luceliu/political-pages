## Visual rationale
> Your writeup should include the rationale for your design choices, focusing on the interaction aspects and focusing on the interaction aspects and connecting these choices to a data abstraction (including a characterization of the raw data types and their scale/cardinality, and of any derived data that you decided to compute) and the task abstraction. You should also concisely describe your visual encoding choices.


## Vision
We decided to pivot away from our novel square glyph chart, as its narrative seemed too similar to the bubble chart's. The old goals of comparing truthfulness across different political leanings, and across different post types, remain. We also want to explicitly explore the interplay between post quantity and truthfulness at an overview scale, and we've chosen a new visualization, which lists each page with two circles size-coded to represent the number of posts of a certain Rating against all posts for that Page. These pages are then ranked by the Rating count descending. We feel that this more saliently conveys the relationship between how much each page posts and how much is truthful.

> Say something else about whether "your visualization enable the tasks you set out to facilitate or successfully communicate the story you want to tell?"

## Data processing
In addition to the data taken directly from [our dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fact-checking-facebook-politics-pages/data), we dynamically compute the total count of posts per Rating for each Page. We also compute the total number of posts
